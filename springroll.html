		<h3 id="a">Instructions</h3>
		<h3 id="a">1.Cut up your shrimp</h3>
		<p id="c">
Completely peel your each shrimp ensuring that there are no pieces of tail or legs left behind.<br>
Peel them from the middle of their torso, where the legs are located, out. Once peeled, carefully cut them in half lengthwise. <br>
If you love cucumber or lettuce, feel free to add to the recipe.<br> 
Not only will the cucumber add to the taste but it will also add crunch to the rolls. <br>
Remember to peel the cucumber and lettuce into matchstick sized pieces.</p>

<h3 id="a">2.Assemble all your ingredients</h3>
<p id="c"> Gather your ingredients together to speed up the wrapping process.<br>
Keep your shrimp, noodles, rice paper , lettuce and bean sprouts together as a wrapping station.<br>
Having a wrapping station is especially helpfully if cooking a large amount of spring rolls<br>
or working with your kids to create a fun assembly line.</p>

<h3 id="a">3.Wet the rice paper wrappers</h3>
<p id="c"> Upon opening the rice paper wrappers, you’ll find they are similar to a hard piece of paper.<br>
 In order to soften them, you want to fill a large pot or deep plate with a small amount of warm water.<br>
Lay a singular paper in the pot and count to five slowly.<br>
Gently remove the wrapper from the water once you find that it is soft and pliable and place it on porous cloth.<br>
 A cotton pillowcase or tablecloth should work well.<br>
Don’t soak a wrapper too long and only soak wrappers one at a time. <br>
Soaking more than one wrapper at once will cause the wrappers to stick together.<br>
 Soaking a wrapper too long will make it too soggy and it will easily fall apart.</p>

<h3 id="a">4.Fill your spring rolls</h3>
<p id="c">Fill your spring rolls. Lay down your filling across the middle approximately two thirds into the wrap.<br> 
Start by laying down the mint. Mint can be overpowering so try using three to four leaves per wrapper depending on your taste.<br>
Next, lay four to five pieces of shrimp over the mint.<br>
Add a small amount of carrot or any other vegetables. <br>
Lastly, cover this layer of vegetables with noodles and lettuce.<br>
Keep in mind that the mint and shrimp will act as decorative colors through the paper. <br>
Try alternating where you place them to keep your rolls looking fresh and beautiful.<br>
Always keep your vegetables in the middle of the roll. Rice wrapper paper is very fragile and will tear easily.<br>
 By sandwiching the vegetables, you prevent the hard carrots from poking through the wrap.<br>
You want the filling to take up approximately 60% of the roll’s length. <br>
When laying the filling across the roll, ensure you have left enough room on each side of the filling for the wrapper to be lifted and tucked around the filling.</p>

<h3 id="a">5.Wrap the roll</h3>
<p id="c">Lift the sides over the filling.<br> 
To prevent your rolls from falling apart, you need to keep it tight.<br>
 Don’t pull too hard or allow the sides to become sloppy. <br>
After the ends are folded over the filling, tuck the shorter remaining end over the pile of filling.<br>
Now you should have a roll that has three edges of the wrapper tucked around the filling. <br>
Using care, roll the paper and stuffing towards the last remaining edge.<br>
Always use two hands to roll your spring rolls. <br>
It may take some getting used to, and your first few rolls might not be the prettiest, but you’ll find that each successive roll becomes easier.</p>

<h3 id="a">6.Roll until the wrapper is completely used</h3>
<p id="c">When storing your spring rolls, keep them laid on the side with the exposed wrapper.</p>
