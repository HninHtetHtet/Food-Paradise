		<h4 id="a">Ingredients</h4>
		<ul id="c">
			<li>4 T canola oil or vegetable oil</li><br>
<li>5-6 oz beef stew meat, cut into thin strips</li><br>
<li>1 large or 2 small carrot, julienned (approx 1 C)</li><br>
<li>1 onion, sliced thin</li><br>
<li>1 bunch spinach</li><br>
<li>10 oz Korean glass noodles/cellophane noodles (당면 Dangmyeon)</li><br>
<li>about 2/3 of a 500 g/17 oz package</li><br>
<li>1 C fresh or 1/2 dried wood ear mushroom (목이버섯 mokibeoseot)</li><br>
<li>substitution/addition – dried shitake or oyster mushrooms</li><br>
</ul>
		<strong>Beef marinade</strong>
<ul>
<li>2 1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
<li>1 1/2 ~ 2 tsp sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
<li>1 tsp rice cooking wine</li>
<li>1/2 tsp garlic powder (or 1/4 tsp fresh chopped garlic)</li>
</ul>
<strong>Seasoning for the Dangmyeon(Glass Noodles)for 8 C cooked</strong> 
<ul>
<li>4 T soy sauce</li>
<li>2 T sugar</li>
<li>3 T sesame oil</li>
</ul>
<div id="c">
<p>		1.Cut beef into thin strips, against the grain.
		 If you want an easy way out, you can also use bulgogi meat cut into smaller pieces.<br>
2. Mix the beef marinade in a bowl big enough to hold the beef.
	 Add the beef, massage it with your hands and let it sit for a few<br>
  minutes while  you prepare the vegetables.  I used garlic powder
   here because the garlic flavor doesn’t need to be very strong<br>
    in this dish but you can  certainly use fresh garlic if you prefer.<br>
3. Boil 8-10 C of water in a pot and cook the dangmyeon according to package instructions
	(e.g.6 min) or until the noodles become <br>
	clear and is soft all the way to the center of the noodle.
	 More water is better than too little since the glass noodles soak quite a bit of water.<br>
4. Once the noodles are cooked, rinse in cold water and drain.
	 While noodles are still warm, season them with soy sauce, sugar and sesame oil. <br>
	 Cut the noodles with scissors a few times so they are easier to eat. 
	Coating the noodles with oil will keep the noodles from sticking together.</p>

<p>5.Wash the spinach. Boil another pot of salted water (6 C or so + 1 tsp salt)
 and quickly blanch them. Do not cook the spinach more than 1 minute.<br>
 Spinach should be still a bit chewy and not too mushy. 
Shock the cooked spinach in cold or ice water to stop the cooking process.
		 <br>
Drain the water and squeeze out any excess water from the spinach by 
squeezing them gently in your hand.</p>

<p>6.Season the blanched spinach with some salt (1 tsp) and sesame oil (1 tsp). Set aside.<br>
7. If using dried mushrooms soak them in some warm water for 10 min or so until they 
are fully hydrated.<br>
8. Clean the fresh or rehydrated mushrooms by rubbing each mushroom under cold running water.
<br> Sometimes dirt/sand are buried in the mushroom (especially the part that’s a bit 
bumpy like a towel)so make sure all the dirt is washed off.<br> 
You can also cut off the ends that has the dirt.</p>

 <p>Cut mushrooms into 1/3 to 1/2 in wide strips.
 If using shitake mushrooms, slice them into 1/4 in thick slices. Set aside.<br>
 9. Julienne carrots and onions and set aside.</p>

<p>10. Saute each of the ingredients separately and let them cool.
You can save yourself the trouble of washing more pans by using
 one frying pan<br> and sauteing ingredients  one by one in the following order:
onions carrots  mushrooms  beef.
 Just wipe off any excess oil and crumbs with a paper<br>towel after cooking 
 each ingredient and you should be good to go!
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10.1Add 1 T oil in frying pan on medium heat.
	 Add onions and sprinkle a pinch of salt.
	 Saute until onions become transparent but not brown.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10.2 Add 1 T oil in frying pan on medium heat. 
	Add carrots and a pinch of salt. Saute carrots until they are soft and tender.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10.3 Add 1 T oil in frying pan on medium heat. 
	Add mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Saute for 3 mins or so and the mushrooms should be done.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">10.4 Add 1/2 T oil in frying pan on medium-high heat. 
	Saute the beef until they are fully cooked. If there are any extra juices in
	 the pan,<br> cook a little more until it’s evaporated.
<p>11. Transfer each of the onions, carrots, mushrooms and beef to a plate and let them cool.</p>

<p>12. It’s time to put everything together! Add all the cooked vegetables and beef to the noodles
	 and mix them altogether.
 <br>Sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds. Taste some noodles with the vegetables and the beef. 
 Adjust the seasoning with more soy<br> sauce and sugar as needed.
  Unless you like things less salty and sweet, it will taste better if you add more soy saucesugarand
 <br> a dash of   sesame oil and black pepper as the final finishing touch.</p>
